## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
Find3D consists of a data engine which automatically annotates training data and an open-world 3D part segmentation model trained on diverse objects provided by the data engine. We share code both for the data engine and the model. Scripts for various steps of the data engine are explained in [`dataengine/README.md`](dataengine/README.md). Below we demonstrate how to perform inference both on benchmarks and on user-provided point cloud files with Find3D. We also provide the command to train Find3D from scratch.

## Environment Setup <a name="environment"></a>
Both the data engine and the Find3D model require GPU with cuda support. The data engine and the model requires different environments. The data engine environment setup can be found in [`dataengine/README.md`](dataengine/README.md). Below we share the model environment.
```
cd model
conda create -n find3d python=3.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Build Pointcept from source
```
git clone https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept.git
cd /Pointcept/libs/pointops
python setup.py install
cd ../../..
```
Build FlashAttention from source
```
git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git
cd flash-attention MAX_JOBS=4 python setup.py install
cd ..
```
Building FlashAttention might take up to three hours.

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
See [`model/evaluation/benchmark/README.md`](model/evaluation/benchmark/README.md) for instructions on downloading the benchmarks for evaluation.

## Data Engine <a name="dataengine"></a>
The environment setup for the data engine, as well as scripts for various steps, are detailed in [`dataengine/README.md`](dataengine/README.md).

## Inference on Benchmarks <a name="infbench"></a>
To run inference on benchmarks, please first download the benchmark data according to [the Dataset section](#dataset). We provide a trained checkpoint [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_nQGG8OfnWli62FrpY31KgKJX3mpOG5U/view?usp=drive_link).
Please run the following scripts in the [`model`](model/) folder, and set the `PYTHONPATH` before running inference:
```
cd model
export PYTHONPATH=[path to Find3D]
```
Evaluation configurations can be changed via flags:

By default, "part of a object" query is used. One can set `--part_query` flag to use "part" query on all benchmarks, or set `--use_shapenetpart_topk_prompt` flag to use the topk prompt (following PointCLIPV2) for ShapeNetPart or Objaverse-ShapeNetPart.

By default, evaluation is done on the full set. One can set `--subset` flag to evaluate on subset of ShapeNetPart and PartNetE.

By default, rotation is applied to all objects. On ShapeNetPart and PartNetE, one can set `--canonical` flag to evaluate in the canonical orientation.


Example command to evaluate on Objaverse
```
python evaluation/benchmark/eval_benchmark.py --benchmark Objaverse --data_root [data root] --objaverse_split unseen --checkpoint_path [your downloaded checkpoint path]
```

Example command to evaluate on ShapeNetPart
```
python evaluation/benchmark/eval_benchmark.py --data_root [data root] --benchmark ShapeNetPart --checkpoint_path [your downloaded checkpoint path]
```
Example command to evaluate on PartNetE test set
```
python evaluation/benchmark/eval_benchmark.py --benchmark PartNetE --data_root [data root --checkpoint_path [your downloaded checkpoint path]
```

## Inference in the Wild (Demo) <a name="infwild"></a>
Find3D can also be evaluated on object point clouds in the wild - 3D digital assets or 3D reconstructions from 2D. We provide a trained checkpoint [here](provide link). [`model/evaluation/demo/eval_visualize.py`](model/evaluation/demo/eval_visualize.py) can take in any point cloud (as a .pcd file) and queries, and produce both a segmentation (using all queries) and a heatmap for each query. The segmentation and heatmaps will open in your browser as plotly visualizations that can be dragged and rotated. If you use ssh to connect to a headless server via Visual Studio Code, the plotly visualization will open in the browser of the client machine (e.g. your laptop browser).
Please run the commands below from the [`model`](model/) directory, and set `PYTHONPATH` as the path of this repo.
```
cd model
export PYTHONPATH=[path to find3d]
```
Two modes are supported: segmentation or heatmap, controlled by the flag `--mode`. For segmentation, all queries will be used to segment the object. For heatmap, you will obtain a heatmap for each query - each opening in a new browser window.

Example command to perform segmentation on an in-the-wild point cloud in .pcd format
```
python evaluation/demo/eval_visualize.py --object_path evaluation/demo/mickey.py --checkpoint_path [your downloaded checkpoint path] --mode segmentation --queries "head" "ear" "arm" "leg" "body" "hand" "shoe"
```
Example command to obtain query heatmap on an in-the-wild point cloud in .pcd format
```
python evaluation/demo/eval_visualize.py --object_path evaluation/demo/mickey.py --checkpoint_path [your downloaded checkpoint path] --mode heatmap --queries "hand" "shoe"
```

## Training <a name="training"></a>
Find3D's data loader works with data in the format provided by the data engine. Each training object should have a mask data directory and a point data directory.

The mask data directory should contain:
* `allmasks.pt` (n_masks,500,500)
* `mask_labels.txt` (n_masks rows, each row a label)
* `mask2pts.pt` (shape (n_masks,n_pts), binary, indicating which masks correspond to which points)
* `mask2view.pt` (this is shape (n_masks,) each entry is a view id 0-9)

The point directory should contain:
* `normals.pt` (n_points,3)
* `points.pt`(n_points,3)
* `rgb.pt` (n_points,3)
* `point2face.pt` (which point corresponds to which face)

Details can be found in the implemetation of the dataset classes in [`model/data/data.py`](model/data/data.py).

With data generated by the data engine, Find3D can be trained from scratch using the following command:
```
python training/train.py --ckpt_dir=[checkpoint dir] --lr=0.0003 --eta_min=0.00005 --batch_size=64 --n_epoch=80 --exp_suffix=[experiment name]
```
